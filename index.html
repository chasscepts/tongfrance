    Hello Camper!
 #4: The projects section should contain at least one element with a class of project-tile to hold a project.

User Story #5: The projects section should contain at least one link to a project.

User Story #6: My portfolio should have a navbar with an id of navbar.

    For now, the test suite only works in Chrome!
    Please read the README below in the JS Editor before beginning.
    Feel free to delete this message once you have read it.
    Good luck and Happy Coding!
